AC-Digital-Subscriptions
========================

Instructions for American Corners to add digital versions of their print subscriptions to electronic devices such as tablets, iPads and eReaders.

This is a Virtual Intern project of the U.S. Department of State, initiated by Carol Bean, IRO for the Western Balkan region.  The project's goal is to identify print subscriptions to American journals and magazines at American Corners that have digital access available, and create instructions for American Corners to access the digital component of their subscriptions on electronic devices.
